This is a project I'm creating for one of my University courses at Link√∂ping University Biomedicine programe. 
It's going to analyze a test that has a color change indicator, that changes color depending on the precense and concentration of Acid Phosphatase. 

This is my first attempt to use Machine learning, this so that the test also can be used to indetity structures later, when we want to analyze multipe wells.
