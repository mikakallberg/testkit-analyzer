This is a project I'm creating for one of my University courses at Link√∂ping University Biomedicine programe. 
It's going to analyze a test that has a color change indicator, that changes color depending on the precense and concentration of Acid Phosphatase. 

This is my first attempt to use Machine learning, this so that the test also can be used to indetity structures later, when we want to analyze multipe wells.

## Thoughts during experiment
- The paper images shows the importance of outlining an area for analyziz. Preliminary analyziz shows difference in result connected to number of clusters used.
